Priced at $ 180 , it might stretch some budgets , but we found that its featherlight design with a low stack height is primed for short trail races . On top of that , we discovered that the fantastic Vibram Megagrip outsole guarantees solid traction across varied terrains . However , it 's only tailored for those with medium or narrow feet .",
