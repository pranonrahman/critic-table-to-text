          "verdict": "With its 1200W base , the Ninja 3-in-1 Food Processor with Auto-IQ BN800UK is an extremely powerful food processor and blender , all-in-one . In the box , you get everything you need to blend , mix , chop , slice and grate , plus a self-serve blending cup to take on the move . Performance is generally excellent across the board , with the AutoIQ programmes making many jobs even easier . The BN800UK made short work of crushing ice , blending ingredients and chopping , slicing and dicing . Smaller dry ingredients prove hard to grind , and the food processor is very loud , but that aside you get a lot of machine for a great price .",
